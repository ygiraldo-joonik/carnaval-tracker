# React Native Travel Tracker App

This project was developed using **React Native**, specifically with the **Expo** framework. It consists of an app that allows users to start a trip. While the trip is active, the app accesses the user's location in the background every 30 seconds and logs the coordinates for that trip. Once the trip is completed, users can access the details view to see all the recorded locations.

### Project Status
This project is still in its early stages and serves as a proof of concept to present to the client. As such, features like linters or tests have not been implemented yet.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
